Hypernodes
---

Edges have the ability to have parentage.  Hypernodes extend this functionality
to allow for N-dimensional node parentage.

Single parentage versioning is implemented in the UI via versioned nodes.  Multiparentage
Hypernodes are not supported via the UI.

The Derivation of a node determines its parentage.
